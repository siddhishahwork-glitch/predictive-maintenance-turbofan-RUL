Developed Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction model for turbofan engines using multivariate sensor data. 
This project develops a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction model for turbofan jet engines using the NASA CMAPSS FD001 dataset.
The goal is to forecast how many operating cycles remain before an engine fails, enabling proactive maintenance and improved reliability.

The final model uses a leakage-free LSTM neural network, achieving:

📉 RMSE: 23.14 cycles

📉 MAE: 16.28 cycles

These results are fully aligned with published benchmarks for FD001.
